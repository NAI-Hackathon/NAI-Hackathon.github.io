            <p> <b>What is HackNA?</b> </p>
            <p class="info small"> HackNA is a hackathon, bringing the joy of 
                technology and problem-solving to high school students. 
                In 2023's mini-hackathon, over the course of 7 hours, participants
                will create a project from scratch. Their project can, but is not 
                required to, relate to this year's theme of <b> Water </b> and the environment. 
            </p>

            <p> <b>Making a difference!</b> </p>
            <p class="info small"> We decided to bring HackNA back for young 
                students to give them to innovate: discover what they're capable of 
                making. While many hackathons are geared towards adults or college 
                students, our hackathon gives younger kids the opportunity to 
                explore the engineering/technology field. HackNA 2023 will have a variety
                of workshops, catering to a wide range of students: from people who have 
                never even heard of programming to seasoned experts. 
                
            </p>

            <p> <b>Why sponsor us?</b> </p>
            <p class="info small"> You can give back to the community. Your contribution 
                would make this possible by fostering a diverse community of aspiring engineers.
                <br>
                Sponsoring us is also a great way to advertise your brand and interact with future innovators.
